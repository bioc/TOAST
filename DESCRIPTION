Package: TOAST
Type: Package
Title: Tools for the analysis of heterogeneous tissues
Version: 1.9.4
Description: This package is devoted to analyzing high-throughput data (e.g. gene expression microarray, DNA methylation microarray, RNA-seq) from complex tissues. Current functionalities include 1. detect cell-type specific or cross-cell type differential signals 2. tree-based differential analysis  3. improve variable selection in reference-free deconvolution 4. partial reference-free deconvolution with prior knowledge.
