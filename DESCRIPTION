Description: This package is devoted to analyzing high-throughput data (e.g. gene expression microarray, DNA methylation microarray, RNA-seq) from complex tissues. Current functionalities include 1. detect cell-type specific or cross-cell type differential signals  2. improve variable selection in reference-free deconvolution 3. partial reference-free deconvolution with prior knowledge.
